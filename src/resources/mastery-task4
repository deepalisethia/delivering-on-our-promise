PromiseDao currently works only with DPS (Delivery Promise Service)

We need to get promises from OFS (Order Fulfillment Service)



Use Cases

Create a diagram to understand how Promise Dao works.


Proposed Solution
How will my changes satisfy my use cases above?

How will I allow new promise sources to be added easily in the future?

Out of Scope
Consider a reviewer who misunderstands this design and believes you're not going to make PromiseDao perfect.
What am I not going to do?

Details
Make a UML diagram to clarify the changes I want to make.
Can leave out classes that don't participate in the new solution, but leave in anything using updates.
Include a link to te plantUML source.

What calls will the software make,
How will it process the results,
Satisfy all use cases.

What do we expect the complexity of this solution to be and why?
